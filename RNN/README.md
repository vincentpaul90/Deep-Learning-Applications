# Predicting Sentiment Ratings Using RNN with Keras

---

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)** in predicting sentiment ratings for text data. By leveraging the capabilities of the **Keras** framework, the notebook provides an end-to-end implementation, including data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

The project uses publicly available datasets and focuses on showcasing advanced skills in **deep learning** for **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** tasks.
