    "\n",
    "I am going to show how to use the Keras library to build both a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model and a recurrent neural network (RNN) model that predict sentiment ratings for text sequences. Specifically, the models will predict the ratings associated with movie reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color='#6629b2'>Neural Networks for Language Data</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, neural networks encoded encode some input variables via a set of parameters (weights) that are optimized to predict some output variable. The simplest type of neural network is a feed-forward multilayer perceptron (MLP) which operates on some feature representation of a linguistic input. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are an extension of this simple model that specifically model the sequential aspect of the input and thus are particularly useful for natural language processing tasks. The notebook demonstrates the code needed to assemble MLP and RNN models for an NLP task using the Keras library, as well as some data processing tools that facilitate building the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you understand how to structure the input and output of the model, and know the fundamental concepts in machine learning, then a high-level understanding of how a neural network works is sufficient for using Keras. You'll see that most of the code here is actually just data manipulation, and I'll visualize each step in this process. The code used to assemble the models themselves is more minimal. It is of course useful to know these details, so you can theorize on the results and innovate the model to make it better. For a better understanding of neural networks and RNNs in particular, see the resources at the bottom of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here a neural network will be used to encode the text of a movie review, and this representation will be used to predict the numerical rating assigned by the reviewer. The model shown here can be applied to any task where the goal is to predict a numerical score associated with a piece of text. Hopefully you can substitute your own datasets and/or modify the code to adapt it to other tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color='#6629b2'>Keras</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "[Keras](https://keras.io/) is a Python deep learning framework that lets you quickly put together neural network models with a minimal amount of code. It can be run on top of the mathematical optimization libraries [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) or [Tensor Flow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) without you needing to know either of these underlying frameworks. It provides implementations of several of the layer architectures, objective functions, and optimization algorithms you need for building a machine learning model."

The ratings are on a 1-10 scale, but the dataset specifically contains \"polarized\" reviews: positive reviews with a rating of 7 or higher, and negative reviews with a rating of 4 or lower. There are an equal number of positive and negative reviews. In the full dataset, the reviews are divided into train and test sets with 25,000 reviews each. Here I'm just going to load a sample training set of 100 reviews. You can download the full dataset at the above link."

Now 40 years old, it has lost none of it's power. Neil Simon displays excellent insight into human nature and relationships as well as how to create genuine comedy from unusual situations. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau give great comedic performances. Neil Simon was inspired by actual events in his own life to write the play this film is based on.  One of the best written and acted Hollywood comedies of all time!  Surprisingly, only nominated for 2 Academy Awards: \\\"Best Adapted Screenplay\\\" and \\\"Best Film Editing\\\". Hollywood rarely awards comedies, no matter how well they are made.\",\n          \"As I watched this movie, and I began to see its' characters develop I could feel this would be an excellent picture. When you get that feeling, and the movie indeed fills those expectations the experience is rare. I had that very feeling throughout this movie. Robert DeNiro and Cuba Gooding Junior played riveting and amazingly strong parts which were both Oscar worthy. The supporting cast was equally as strong creating a winning foundation for the picture to grow on. I can say without any hesitation at all, see this movie it will not disappoint.\",\n          \"\\\"Trigger Man\\\" is definitely the most boring and silliest movie I've ever seen in my life. My aunt's holiday videos are more fascinating.  The actors seem to be recruited at uglypeople.com. They do not have any talent to act in a convincing manner.  They walk and walk and walk through the forest. There's more walking-around than in all three parts of \\\"The Lord of the Rings\\\" together. After the first hour, I began to read a Porsche brochure while watching \\\"Trigger Man\\\" along the way. Awful.  A total waste of time and money.

Once you load a spaCy model for a particular language, you can provide any text as input to the model, e.g. encoder(text) and access its linguistic features."

Now 40 years old, it has lost none of it's power. Neil Simon displays excellent insight into human nature and relationships as well as how to create genuine comedy from unusual situations. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau give great comedic performances. Neil Simon was inspired by actual events in his own life to write the play this film is based on.  One of the best written and acted Hollywood comedies of all time!  Surprisingly, only nominated for 2 Academy Awards: \\\"Best Adapted Screenplay\\\" and \\\"Best Film Editing\\\". Hollywood rarely awards comedies, no matter how well they are made.\",\n          \"As I watched this movie, and I began to see its' characters develop I could feel this would be an excellent picture. When you get that feeling, and the movie indeed fills those expectations the experience is rare. I had that very feeling throughout this movie. Robert DeNiro and Cuba Gooding Junior played riveting and amazingly strong parts which were both Oscar worthy. The supporting cast was equally as strong creating a winning foundation for the picture to grow on. I can say without any hesitation at all, see this movie it will not disappoint.\",\n          \"\\\"Trigger Man\\\" is definitely the most boring and silliest movie I've ever seen in my life. My aunt's holiday videos are more fascinating.  The actors seem to be recruited at uglypeople.com. They do not have any talent to act in a convincing manner.  They walk and walk and walk through the forest. There's more walking-around than in all three parts of \\\"The Lord of the Rings\\\" together. After the first hour, I began to read a Porsche brochure while watching \\\"Trigger Man\\\" along the way. Awful.  A total waste of time and money. I'd give that movie 0 stars out of 10, since this is not possible, I have to give 1 star.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Tokenized_Review\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Each tokenized word in the reviews is added to the lexicon, and then each word is mapped to a numerical index that can be read by the model. Since large datasets may contain a huge number of unique words, it's common to filter all words occurring less than a certain number of times, and replace them with some generic &lt;UNK&gt; token. The min_freq parameter in the function below defines this threshold. When assigning the indices, the number 1 will represent unknown words. The number 0 will represent \"empty\" word slots, which is explained below. Therefore \"real\" words will have indices of 2 or higher."

    "Before I show how to build an RNN for this task, I'll demonstrate an even simpler model, a multilayer perceptron (MLP). Unlike an RNN, an MLP model is not a sequence model - it represents data as a flat matrix of features rather than a time-ordered sequence of features. For language data, this generally means that the word order of a sequence will not be explicitly encoded into a model. The importance of word order varies for different NLP tasks; in some cases, order-sensitive approaches do not necessarily perform better.\n",

    "The simplest and most common representation of a text in NLP is as a bag-of-words vector. A bag-of-words vector encodes a sequence as an array with a dimension for each word in the lexicon. The value for each dimension is the number of times the word corresponding to that dimension appears in the text. Thus a dataset of text sequences is encoded as a matrix where each row represents a sequence and each column represents a word whose value is the frequency of that word in the sequence (it is also common to apply some weighting function to these values such as [tf-idf](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/tf-idf-weighting-1.html), but here we'll just use counts).\n",
    "\n",
    "You may notice that the first dimension of the matrix has a count of 0 for all reviews, since there are no words represented by 0. This dimension is only relevant for the RNN model, where 0 will be used in a special way to indicate null words. This is explained fully below. For the MLP model, including this dimension won't make a difference because the model will learn to ignore it in making predictions."

    "To assemble the model, we'll use Keras' [Functional API](https://keras.io/getting-started/functional-api-guide/), which is one of two ways to use Keras to assemble models (the alternative is the [Sequential API](https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide/), which is a bit simpler but has more constraints). A model consists of a series of layers. As shown in the code below, we initialize instances for each layer. Each layer can be called with another layer as input, e.g. Dense()(input_layer). A model instance is initialized with the Model() object, which defines the initial input and final output layers for that model. Before the model can be trained, the compile() function must be called with the loss function and optimization algorithm specified (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "###  <font color='#6629b2'>Layers</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll build an MLP with four layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Input**: The input layer takes in the matrix of sequence vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Dense (sigmoid activation)**: A hidden [layer](https://keras.io/layers/core/#dense), which is what defines the model as a multilayer perceptron. This layer transforms the input matrix by applying a nonlinear transformation function (here, the sigmoid function). Intuitively, this layer can be thought of as computing a \"feature representation\" of the input words matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Dense (linear activation)**: An output layer that predicts the rating for the review based on its hidden representation given by the previous layer. This output is continuous (i.e. ranging from 1-10) rather than categorical, which means it has linear activation rather than nonlinear like the hidden layer (by default, activation='linear' for the Dense layer in Keras). The model gets feedback during training about what the actual ratings for the reviews should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"layer\" is just an abstraction, when really all these layers are just matrices. The \"weights\" that connect the layers are also matrices. The process of training a neural network is a series of matrix multiplications. The weight matrices are the values that are adjusted during training in order for the model to learn to predict ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  <font color='#6629b2'>Parameters</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our function for creating the model takes two parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "**n_input_nodes**: In the case of reviews encoded as bag-of-words vectors, this is the number of unique words in the lexicon, plus one to account for the padding represented by 0 values (which are only relevant for the RNN model, but this dimension can be included here without any cost to the model).\n",
    "\n",
    "**n_hidden_nodes**: the number of dimensions in the hidden layers. This can be freely chosen; here, it is set to 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  <font color='#6629b2'>Procedure</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the model is a single continuous value (the predicted rating), making this a regression rather than a classification model. There is only one dimension in the output layer, which contains the predicted rating. All neural networks learn by updating the parameters (weights) to optimize an objective (loss) function. For this model, the objective is to minimize the mean squared error between the predicted ratings and the actual ratings for the training reviews, thus bringing the predicted ratings closer to the real ratings. The details of this process are extensive; see the resources at the bottom of the notebook if you want a deeper understanding. One huge benefit of Keras is that it implements many of these details for you. Not only does it already have implementations of the types of layer architectures, it also has many of the [loss functions](https://keras.io/losses/) and [optimization methods](https://keras.io/optimizers/) you need for training various models. The specific loss function and optimization method you use is specified when compiling the model with the compile() function."

As was the case with THE BRONX EXECUTIONER (1989), which preceded it, this is a prime example from the tail end of the Euro-Cult era \\u2013 prime because it shows the depths to which the previously invigorating style had fallen by this time!   Here, in fact, we get a plot revolving around \\u2013 I\\u2019m not kidding, folks \\u2013 a killer phone! Pretty but bland Charlotte Lewis \\u2013 in her third film after PIRATES (1986) and THE GOLDEN CHILD (1986) \\u2013 is a model who, apparently, has just ended an affair; she keeps expecting her architect lover to call her back but, every time the phone rings, all she gets is static accompanied by voices from the beyond (or some such crap). She befriends a new tenant at her apartment block who, conveniently, knows of an authority on paranormal activity (William Berger) \\u2013 who, hilariously, explains that the negative energy which is unleashed, say, during family arguments can manifest itself via home appliances into a deadly force (I swear I ain\\u2019t making this up)!   Among the highlights...er...lowpoints of the film are: the grumpy bartender from whose dingy place the heroine calls a couple of times (it seems that the chain-of-events can only be broken by having Lewis go through her paces again, EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962)-style!), the sheer variety of preposterous-looking phones on display, the apparatus of the heroine\\u2019s photographer friend sneaking up on her before the kill, the sarcastic cop who greets Lewis on reporting the strange occurrences (\\u201cAnd what\\u2019s the toaster up to, I wonder?\\u201d), the would-be rapist killed by a barrage of coins shooting out from a telephone booth, and Berger\\u2019s own bloody demise (with the phone affecting the pacemaker he\\u2019s fitted with and causing the doctor\\u2019s heart to explode)!   The film\\u2019s climax is rather confusing and, apparently, finally sees all the \\u2018lost souls\\u2019 inhabiting a flock of doves and flying out the window of the \\u2018possessed\\u2019 office (a lonelyhearts service!). For what it\\u2019s worth, the score \\u2013 by ex-Goblin Claudio Simonetti no less \\u2013 is effective enough, despite the inclusion of dated heavy-metal numbers on the soundtrack.\",\n          \"What is wrong with CURACAO ( Also known as DEADLY CURRENTS though what the reasonn for the name change is I have no idea ) can probably be summed up where a woman says to her lover :  \\\" Keep it down baby , I'm trying to sleep \\\"   It's not the dialogue that's the problem or the way it's delivered , it's the fact the actress has has a Central European accent . Nothing wrong with that until it's revealed her character is from Philidelphia in the United States ! This what struck me about this thriller while watching it - The way accents don't match their characters . Apart from the Philly woman with a German accent we see a South African with an English accent , a local police chief who sounds like he's an Irishman impersonating a Gestapo officer and worst of all George C Scott playing someone who's either Dutch or British with an accent that sounds like it might be American tinged with South African . You soon give up following what's on screen and end up concentrating on what nationality a character might be due to the strange way they speak . It's interesting to note that this site hasn't given this movie a country of origin . With so many different actors from different countries you do feel that this was produced by the United Nations   Even if you're not curious about accents or dialects you'll probably have to give up following the action anyway because CURACAO is plot less . Things happen like a boat exploding , and a hostage situation and the hero being recruited as an agent for South African intelligence but you're left scratching your head wondering what the heck this is all leading to .

    "An alternative to the traditional bag-of-words representation is to encode sequences as a combination of their individual word embeddings. A word embedding is an n-dimensional vector of real values that together are intended to encode the \"meaning\" of a word. Word embedding models explicitly learn to represent words by trying to correctly predict other words that appear in the same context (or alternatively, trying to predict a word based on the context words). The result of these models are embedding vectors for words such that words with similar meanings (should) end up having similar vectors.\n",

    "We can use the embeddings as an alternative to the simple bag-of-words input to the model, by averaging the embeddings for all words in the review across each corresponding dimension (you could also sum them). So instead of having an input matrix with a column for each word in the lexicon, each column represents a word embedding dimension. This is referred to as a continuous bag-of-words vector. The advantage of this representation over the standard bag-of-words representation is that it more explicitly represents the meaning of the words in the review. For example, two reviews may express similar content (and have similar ratings) but may vary in the exact words they use, so their continous bag-of-word vectors may be more similar than their standard bag-of-words vectors. The model may more readily observe that these reviews should receive similar ratings."

As was the case with THE BRONX EXECUTIONER (1989), which preceded it, this is a prime example from the tail end of the Euro-Cult era \\u2013 prime because it shows the depths to which the previously invigorating style had fallen by this time!   Here, in fact, we get a plot revolving around \\u2013 I\\u2019m not kidding, folks \\u2013 a killer phone! Pretty but bland Charlotte Lewis \\u2013 in her third film after PIRATES (1986) and THE GOLDEN CHILD (1986) \\u2013 is a model who, apparently, has just ended an affair; she keeps expecting her architect lover to call her back but, every time the phone rings, all she gets is static accompanied by voices from the beyond (or some such crap). She befriends a new tenant at her apartment block who, conveniently, knows of an authority on paranormal activity (William Berger) \\u2013 who, hilariously, explains that the negative energy which is unleashed, say, during family arguments can manifest itself via home appliances into a deadly force (I swear I ain\\u2019t making this up)!   Among the highlights...er...lowpoints of the film are: the grumpy bartender from whose dingy place the heroine calls a couple of times (it seems that the chain-of-events can only be broken by having Lewis go through her paces again, EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962)-style!), the sheer variety of preposterous-looking phones on display, the apparatus of the heroine\\u2019s photographer friend sneaking up on her before the kill, the sarcastic cop who greets Lewis on reporting the strange occurrences (\\u201cAnd what\\u2019s the toaster up to, I wonder?\\u201d), the would-be rapist killed by a barrage of coins shooting out from a telephone booth, and Berger\\u2019s own bloody demise (with the phone affecting the pacemaker he\\u2019s fitted with and causing the doctor\\u2019s heart to explode)!   The film\\u2019s climax is rather confusing and, apparently, finally sees all the \\u2018lost souls\\u2019 inhabiting a flock of doves and flying out the window of the \\u2018possessed\\u2019 office (a lonelyhearts service!). For what it\\u2019s worth, the score \\u2013 by ex-Goblin Claudio Simonetti no less \\u2013 is effective enough, despite the inclusion of dated heavy-metal numbers on the soundtrack.\",\n          \"What is wrong with CURACAO ( Also known as DEADLY CURRENTS though what the reasonn for the name change is I have no idea ) can probably be summed up where a woman says to her lover :  \\\" Keep it down baby , I'm trying to sleep \\\"   It's not the dialogue that's the problem or the way it's delivered , it's the fact the actress has has a Central European accent . Nothing wrong with that until it's revealed her character is from Philidelphia in the United States ! This what struck me about this thriller while watching it - The way accents don't match their characters . Apart from the Philly woman with a German accent we see a South African with an English accent , a local police chief who sounds like he's an Irishman impersonating a Gestapo officer and worst of all George C Scott playing someone who's either Dutch or British with an accent that sounds like it might be American tinged with South African . You soon give up following what's on screen and end up concentrating on what nationality a character might be due to the strange way they speak . It's interesting to note that this site hasn't given this movie a country of origin . With so many different actors from different countries you do feel that this was produced by the United Nations   Even if you're not curious about accents or dialects you'll probably have to give up following the action anyway because CURACAO is plot less . Things happen like a boat exploding , and a hostage situation and the hero being recruited as an agent for South African intelligence but you're left scratching your head wondering what the heck this is all leading to .

We'll return to the lists of the word indices contained in train_reviews['Review_Idxs']. The input to the model will be these number sequences themselves. We need to put all the reviews in the training set into a single matrix, where each row is a review and each column is a word index in that sequence. This enables the model to process multiple sequences in parallel (batches) as opposed to one at a time. Using batches significantly speeds up training. However, each review has a different number of words, so we create a padded matrix equal to the length on the longest review in the training set. For all reviews with fewer words, we prepend the row with zeros representing an empty word position. This is why the number 0 was not assigned as a word index in the lexicon. We can tell Keras to ignore these zeros during training."

The difference here is that rather than plugging in embeddings from a pretrained model as before, the word embeddings will be learned inside the model itself. Thus, the input to the model will be the word indices rather than their embeddings, and the embedding values will change as the model is trained. The mask_zero=True parameter in this layer indicates that values of 0 in the matrix (the padding) will be ignored by the model.\n",

As it observes each word in the review, it integrates the word embedding representation with what it's observed so far to compute a representation (hidden state) of the review at that timepoint. There are a few architectures for this layer - I use the GRU variation, Keras also provides LSTM or just the simple vanilla recurrent layer (see the materials at the bottom for an explanation of the difference). This layer outputs the last hidden state of the sequence (i.e. the hidden representation of the review after its last word is observed).\n",
